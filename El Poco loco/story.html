      <h1>Story (Scroll down to read more)</h1>
      <p>
        In a lively desert town, Señor Pedro, a celebrated chef known for his
        fiery dishes, sets his sights on a legendary culinary challenge. The
        Golden Pepper, said to grow in the heart of the desert, holds the secret
        to the spiciest and most flavorful chicken recipe ever. But the pepper
        is fiercely guarded by the massive and menacing El Pollo Supremo, the
        king of the desert chickens.
      </p>

      <p>
        One morning, chaos erupts as Pedro’s mischievous chicken, Loco Pollo,
        runs away into the wild. Chasing after it, Pedro finds himself in the
        treacherous desert, where flocks of unruly chickens defend their
        territory. Armed only with his sombrero, agility, and bottles of his
        signature salsa, Pedro must fight his way through to rescue Loco Pollo
        and claim the Golden Pepper.
      </p>

      <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
      <h3>Enemy Interaction:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Small and Normal Chickens:</strong> These chickens roam the
          desert and attack anyone who gets too close. Pedro can defeat them by
          either:
          <ul>
            <li>Throwing a salsa bottle: A direct hit knocks them out.</li>
            <li>
              Jumping on their heads: A classic move to squish the chickens.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Players must stay sharp to avoid getting overwhelmed by these pesky
          enemies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Boss Mechanic:</h3>
      <p>
        At the end of the level, Pedro faces the mighty El Pollo Supremo, a
        giant chicken fiercely protecting the Golden Pepper.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To defeat El Pollo Supremo, Pedro must hit the boss five times with
          salsa bottles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Challenge:</strong> Each successful hit makes El Pollo Supremo
          more aggressive, speeding up its movements and launching erratic
          attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>High Stakes:</strong> If Pedro runs out of salsa bottles or
          misses too many shots, it’s game over, as there’s no way to defeat the
          boss without hitting him five times.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Salsa Bottles:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Salsa bottles are scattered throughout the level. Players must collect
          enough to ensure they have at least five for the boss fight.
        </li>
        <li>
          Missing too many bottles or using them carelessly against smaller
          enemies risks running out of ammo before the final showdown.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ending</h2>
      <p>
        If Pedro successfully defeats El Pollo Supremo, he rescues Loco Pollo
        and secures the Golden Pepper. Back in the village, he crafts the
        ultimate chicken dish, earning legendary status as the greatest chef in
        the desert. The game ends with a fiesta celebrating Pedro’s success,
        complete with dancing chickens and fireworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he fails, the desert chickens triumph, and the Golden Pepper’s
        secrets remain guarded by El Pollo Supremo... until someone dares to try
        again.
